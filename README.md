**Structured Programming (1970s-1980s**) – Modular programming and languages like C improved code readability and maintainability.

**Agile Revolution (2001-Present)** – The Agile Manifesto introduced flexible, customer-focused development, replacing rigid Waterfall models.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

**Planning** – Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility to ensure alignment with business goals.

**Requirement Analysis** – Gather and document user needs to create functional and technical specifications.

**Design** – Develop system architecture, database structure, and UI/UX designs based on requirements.

**Implementation (Coding)** – Developers write and integrate code following design specifications.

**Testing** – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing).

**Deployment** – Release the software to users, either in phases or as a full rollout.

**Maintenance** – Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements to ensure long-term functionality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies**

Phases	                    One phase at a time	                   Continuous iterations
User Involvement	          Limited	                               Ongoing feedback
Testing	                    After development                      Throughout development
Delivery	                  One final release	Frequent            incremental releases

**Waterfall:**
1. Large government or enterprise projects with fixed requirements (e.g., banking software).

2. Hardware-integrated systems where changes are costly (e.g., medical devices).

**Agile:**
1. Startups or evolving projects requiring flexibility (e.g., mobile apps).

2. Customer-driven software with frequent updates (e.g., e-commerce platforms).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Roles & Responsibilities in a Software Engineering Team**

**1. Software Developer**

- Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.

- Collaborates with designers, analysts, and testers to build software solutions.

- Fixes bugs and optimizes performance.

**2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**

- Designs and executes test plans to identify bugs and ensure software quality.

- Automates testing processes and validates compliance with standards.

- Works with developers to resolve issues and improve reliability.

**3. Project Manager (PM)**

- Oversees project planning, timelines, and resource allocation.

- Coordinates team communication and ensures project goals align with business needs.

- Manages risks, resolves conflicts, and ensures on-time delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development**

**1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**

**Importance:**

- Provides code editing, debugging, and testing tools in one interface.

- Enhances productivity with features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

- Streamlines development with built-in compilers and project management tools.

**Examples:** Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Eclipse.

**2. Version Control Systems (VCS)**

**Importance:**

- Tracks code changes, enabling collaboration among developers.

- Helps revert to previous versions if bugs or issues arise.

- Facilitates branching and merging for parallel development.

**Examples:** Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Apache Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

**Common Challenges & Solutions in Software Engineering**

**1. Managing Changing Requirements**

**Challenge:** Frequent changes can disrupt development.

**Solution:** Use Agile methodologies for flexibility and continuous feedback.

**2. Debugging & Fixing Bugs**

**Challenge:** Identifying and resolving complex issues takes time.

**Solution:** Use debugging tools, automated testing, and code reviews.

**3. Meeting Deadlines**

**Challenge:** Tight schedules can lead to rushed, low-quality code.

**Solution:** Implement proper planning, time management, and realistic goal setting.

**4. Ensuring Code Quality**

**Challenge**: Poorly written code leads to maintenance issues.

**Solution:** Follow best coding practices, conduct peer reviews, and use static code analysis tools.

**5. Collaboration & Communication**

**Challenge:** Miscommunication can cause misunderstandings in project requirements.

**Solution:** Use collaboration tools (JIRA, Slack) and maintain clear documentation.

**6. Security Vulnerabilities**

**Importance:** Ensures that each module works correctly before integration.

**Example:** Testing a single function in a login system.

**2. Integration Testing**

**Definition:** Tests the interaction between multiple modules or components.

**Importance:** Identifies issues in data flow and communication between units.

**Example:** Checking if a user authentication module correctly interacts with a database.

**3. System Testing**

**Definition:** Evaluates the entire system as a whole.

**Importance:** Ensures the complete software meets functional and non-functional requirements.

**Example:** Testing an e-commerce platform’s checkout process.

**4. Acceptance Testing**

**Definition:** Verifies if the software meets business and user requirements.

**Importance:** Determines if the product is ready for deployment.

**Example:** Client testing an invoicing system before final approval.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt Engineering & Its Importance**

**Definition:** Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to optimize the responses of AI models, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.

**Importance**

**- Improves Response Quality** – Well-structured prompts yield precise and meaningful AI outputs.

**- Enhances Efficiency** – Reduces the need for multiple iterations by getting the right response faster.

**- Enables Customization** – Helps tailor AI outputs to specific tasks (e.g., summarization, coding, or translation).

**- Expands AI Use Cases** – Powers applications in automation, content generation, and decision-making.

**Example:**

**Basic Prompt:** "Explain software testing."

**Optimized Prompt:** "Briefly explain the four main types of software testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) with examples."


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Example of a Vague Prompt:**

_"Tell me about security."_

**Improved Prompt:**

_"Explain three key principles of cybersecurity (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) with real-world examples."_

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?

**Clarity** – Specifies the topic (cybersecurity) rather than the broad term "security."

**Specificity** – Focuses on three principles instead of a general overview.

**Conciseness** – Clearly defines the expected response structure.

**Relevance** – Requests real-world examples to improve understanding.
